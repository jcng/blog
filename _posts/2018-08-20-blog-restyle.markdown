I took some time this week to dive into Jekyll and restyle the blog portion of my site to make the entire thing feel more cohesive.<!--break--> The "floating card" style of my about page lent itself well to also displaying blog posts, so conceptually it was easy to figure out my direction.

There was a bit of a learning curve to figuring out how to best add my own style to Jekyll, but I eventually got a hang of overriding the theme and working with the layouts. My experience working with Drupal really helped in that regard.

I also learned a lot about what can be done with Sass, just by looking at the files that come with the default theme. I was really impressed by how organized it all was, and by the clever combinations of variables and calculations to cut down on repeated style rules. I'll be doing my best to emulate that when writing Sass on my own.

There may be some small font and color tweaks I still want to do for the blog, but for now I'm happy with where it's at.

For reference, here is what the blog used to look like:
